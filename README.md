# syntheticdataset-roadsignals

I created synthetic dataset for roadsymbols with Python & Stable Diffusion
The program simply generates images of stop signs, warning signs, regulatory signs, and all United States Road Symbol Signs. 
This dataset can be used for signal detection projects and autonomous systems
